Want to upload your saved memes, in your local computer, on **Google Drive** but too lazy to:
1. open **Google Drive**, 
2. go to the desired directory
3. upload all the pics manually?
Say no more my dear friend :kissing_heart::sunglasses:.
With this script, all of those wille be done, guess what? **AUTOMATICALLY**, muahahaha.

**DETAILS ABOUT HOW TO USE COMING SOON...**
